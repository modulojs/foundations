# Project 2 - Launch Page

In this second project, we'll get practice integrating a sign-up collection
system to create a "coming soon" launch page. This could be useful for gauging
interest in new art projects or business ventures, and in general to build up
hype about a planned project.

The previous project (Project 1) only involved HTML and CSS we've learned so
far. The remaining projects in this lab are harder than the previous, since
they involve incorporating code from different online services, by means of
copy and pasting "magic snippets" of code that add in lots of functionality at
once. This allows you to integrating different online services with sharable
content, embeddable forms, and other such "third party integrations", allowing
you to collect information with forms, play music or videos, or sign people up
for a newsletter.

- NOTE: These "magic snippets" usually consist of a "script tag" or an "iframe
  tag", neither of which we have learned about just yet. If it gets confusing,
  keep this in mind: Don't worry about exactly how script tags or iframes work,
  that's more advanced knowledge you can tackle later. The goal for this
  particular Project Lab is to get practice carefully copying and pasting these
  "embedding" tags so you can quickly embed useful services in your website.


### Can you build the design by looking at the solution?
