# Overview

Welcome to the Foundations of Web Design course.

This course is divided into 4 parts, of 3 lessons each. Each lesson has 4
activities or projects to build. The third lesson of each part is called a
*Project Lab*, because it is focused on combining the skills of the previous
two lessons into several larger and more practical projects.

## Course Parts & Projects

### Part 1 - Single Page Sites

Learn single page and single columns designs. Learn the most
basic core of HTML and CSS, letting you create simple one column
layouts for things like landing pages, profile pages or "link
trees", or business pages.

After just 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in under 2 hours each,
you will have the skills to build each of the following designs, even learning
how to integrate plug-ins that permit e-commerce, audio, video, and more:

* [Personal Landing Page (like "Link Tree")](https://modulojs.github.io/foundations/1.3/solutions/project_1.html)
* [Small Business Page](https://modulojs.github.io/foundations/1.3/solutions/project_2.html)
* [Artist or Creative Page](https://modulojs.github.io/foundations/1.3/solutions/project_2.html)



### Part 2 - Multi Page Sites

Learn how to link together multiple HTML and CSS files. You'll also get a
chance to learn more HTML and CSS concepts, such as tag nesting, classes, and
flex-based column layouts, and be able to build more sophisticated designs with
multiple pages to navigate to.

After only 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in under 2 hours each,
you will have the skills to build more complicated websites, complete with
menus, navigations, subpages, article pages, integrations with Shopify, and
more:

### Part 3 - Forms and Layouts with Tailwind

Learn how to use popular frontend frameworks like Tailwind and popular hosting
platforms like Netlify to rapidly create and deploy sites. You'll also get
practice creating and designing useful, practical forms, allowing for people to
submit information or go through sign-up processes. You'll get practice
integrating with other popular APIs as well, such as Google Fonts and AirTable.

After just 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in under 2 hours each,
you will have the skills to build rich designs using pre-made design elements,
forms that submit their contents, and complex websites that accept more complex
user input:

### Part 4 - Web Components with Modulo

Learn how to build re-usable web components and refactor your code to save time
and rapidly develop more complex sites. You'll learn how to use Modulo.js to
build layouts and individual components with re-usable bits of HTML and CSS.
This last portion of the course will bring your understanding of frontend more
up-to-date with the modern style of making websites, using the so-called
JAM-Stack.

After just 3 lessons that can be completed by beginners in under 2 hours each,
you will have the skills to build web apps that have limited JavaScript-powered
intereactivity. The projects are somewhat more advanced than previous ones, and
show the huge variety of new things you can build with your new skills:
