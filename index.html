    <h2>How to start</h2>

    <p><em>Start the course in 3 steps:</em></p>

    <ol>
        <li><h3>Start with <a 
        target="_blank"
        href="/foundations/1.1/">Lesson 1.1 "HTML Basics"</a></h3> <br />
        <em>Explanation: The course is broken down into lessons (1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
        2.1, etc), and you start with 1.1</em></li>
        <li>
        <h3>Then, do
        <a
        target="_blank"
        href="/slides.html?title=Activity%201&path=/foundations/1.1/activities/act1/instructions.md">Lesson
        1.1 "HTML Basics" / Activity 1 "Hello Coding World"</a></h3>
        <em>Explanation: Each lesson is broken down into a slideshow of
        activities with hands-on learning, each with an accompanying
        instructions slideshow (Activity 1, Activity 2, etc), and you start
        with Activity 1 slideshow open</em></li>

        <li><h3>Then, do
        <a 
        target="_blank"
        href="http://localhost:3334/editor.html?file=/foundations/1.1/activities/act1/challenge1.html">
        Lesson 1.1 / Activity 1 / Challenge 1 - "Hello World"</a></h3>
        <em>Explanation: Each Activity is broken down into at least 4
        challenges, each with accompanying files and instructions (Challenge 1
        with file(s) and instructions, Challenge 2, etc), and you start with
        Challenge 1 file(s) open, as you follow the instructions in the
        slideshow</em></li>

    </ol>

        <h4>Early Access</h4>
        <p>This course isn't finished yet! This is a course that is under public
        development. Think of it as an "early access" or "beta test". For now,
        only the first part is publicly available, however 3 more are in
        development.</p>

        <h2>How to continue to learn</h2>

        <p>Congratulations on starting your coding journey with us!</p>

        <p>Once you've started using the above 3 steps, you have to "rinse and
        repeat": Keep on working through every activity until you complete each
        lesson, and work through all the lessons until you complete the course.
        We try to keep our courses with very clear, straight-forward structure,
        so you know just how much you have done, and how much you have left to
        do!</p>

        <h3>Types of content</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Lessons - These are sets coding activities, slides, and
            occasional videos that can be accomplished in 2 hour intervals.
            They are intended to simulate being in a real workshop-style
            classroom. The activities you do in them help prepare you for the
            Project Labs.</li>
            <li>Project Labs - The goal of a Project Lab is to apply your
            knowledge to bigger designs. These are lessons that don't introduce
            much new material, as much as give repeated practice with concepts
            learned in the previous lessons, along with practical new ways to
            apply the concepts.</li>
            <li>Design Labs - The goal of a Design Lab is to learn skills
            beyond coding: Computer design skills, along with computer power
            user skills necessary for this skillset.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Once you've completed the course, you'll have created as many as
        dozens of useful, fun, and potentially commercially viable websites.
        You'll have also built up your skills in Foundational web design
        knoweldge, and would be ready to jump into learning many different
        other programming languages and frameworks.</p>

        <h2>Rapid learning methodology</h2>

        <p>That is: <strong>How to "do" the course as effectively as possible</strong></p>


        <p>This document (and, soon, videos) will explain how to use the
        learning platform that you are using right now, and our rapid learning
        methodology.  You'll probably have some questions lingering after all
        this, so don't hesitate to ask if you run into any issues with our
        software, or have any questions about our learning methodology.</p>

        <h3>Lessons</h3>
        <p>You should set a timer to complete each lesson in 2 hours. If you
        find yourself stuck on a particular lesson for longer than 2 hours,
        then move-on, and revisit the concept later.</p>

        <h3>Zip file</h3>
        <p>The zip file contains activities directories, demos directories, and
        solution directories. Resist the urge to go into the solutions
        directory when you first get stuck -- you have to power through this,
        no peeking!</p>
        <p>The activities directory consists of a series of project-based
        challenges that get increasingly difficult.  Most activities have an
        instructions.md file, which is a Markdown file with instructions on how
        to complete it.</p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Each activity is divided into a series of challenges. The challenges
        get increasingly difficult. Focus only on completing the first few
        challenges on your "first try" -- you will not have time for all of
        them.</p>
        <p>For beginners, there can be more to learn and understand than what
        can be done in 30 minutes, and so your "first pass" should be about
        breadth not depth. This is to prevent this issue common with beginners,
        where you "miss the forest for the trees", and avoid getting hung up on
        smaller details that will become clearer as you progress. Set a 20-30
        minute timer for each activity. Resist the urge to keep on attempting
        challenges, instead try moving on to the next one. Only after your first
        "2 hour" session for the lesson, then you can go back and repeat the
        harder challenges. The first challenges are designed to warm up, and
        then give some practice on the "gist" of what you are learning, without
        getting bogged down with details or advanced features</p>

    <h2>Learning Locally</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Install an editor or IDE, such as <a
        href="https://www.geany.org/" >Geany</a> (free software) and <a
        href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> (free software), <a
        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> (by Microsoft), or <a
        href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> (freeware).</li>
        <li><a
        href="https://github.com/modulojs/foundations/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">Download
        and extract the Foundations of Web Design Zip file</a>
        <li>Because dealing with so many files can be tricky, get practice
        navigating around the directory using your file browser on your
        computer, e.g. _Finder_ on macOS, _Files_ on Linux / GNOME, or _File
        Explorer_ on Windows</li>
        <li>When you are ready, open the <tt>instructions.md</tt> file of an
        activity in your text editor, along with <tt>challenge1.html</tt> (or
        equivalent, e.g. <tt>ch1/</tt> directory) of an activity to begin the
        lesson.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Tips for learning locally</h3>

    <p><em>These learning tips are on practicing the techniques taught in this
    tutorial on both a local file, as well as the online editor that is
    embedded in this website for convenience.</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li ><p><em>Tip 1:</em> Use code editor on a laptop or desktop computer
        and code editor to practice concepts, in addition to the online one, as
        it's designed just for demonstrating concepts and could feel limiting
        with too much use. However, if necessary, you can still finish it all
        only using the online editors.</p></li>
        <li ><p ><em >Tip 2:</em> The <em>Activity Challenge</em> instructions
        tell you to apply the concepts you learn. Most will have sample code to
        edit and see. It's encouraged to try apply the lesson you learned on a
        component you develop locally on your computer. What does it mean to
        develop locally? This means editing a HTML file separately in a text
        editor (open source options include <a href="https://www.geany.org/" >Geany</a> and
        <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, also Visual
        Studio Code is probably one of the most popular), saved to your computer, also opened in a modern web
        browser (such as <a href="https://firefox.com/">Firefox</a> or Chrome).</p></li>
        <li><p><em>Tip 3:</em> When working locally, developers often like to
        tile the web browser and editor side-by-side, in separate monitors, or
        on big screens so they can see it all at once. You don't need a big
        screen, however, if you can use good key combos!  For example: <code
        class="library_library_Page">Alt+Tab</code> (switch windows, e.g.
        between editor and browser) and <code
        class="library_library_Page">Ctrl+Shift+R</code> (force refresh
        browser).</p></li>
    </ul>
